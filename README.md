# Student-Management-System-
A simple Student Management System in Python allowing users to add, view, update, and delete student records, and categorize grades into HD, D, C, P, or F. It uses loops, conditionals, lists, and tuples to manage data. ChatGPT assisted in planning logic and pseudocode structure for this project.

Student Management System

This project is a Python-based Student Management System developed to reinforce programming fundamentals. The system offers a menu-driven interface allowing users to manage student data effectively. Key features include adding, viewing, updating, and deleting student records, as well as categorising students based on their grades (HD, D, C, P, F). The project showcases core Python concepts such as control structures, loops, conditionals, and data structures like lists and tuples.

The program starts with a looped menu that enables continuous interaction until the user chooses to exit. Each menu option handles a specific function. When adding a student, the program collects the studentâ€™s name and grade, storing them in a list of tuples. The viewing feature displays all stored records. Updating and deleting allow changes to be made using student names. The grade categorisation is handled using conditionals to classify students based on their numeric grade.

This system helps demonstrate how logic and data handling can be effectively implemented using Python basics. It encourages the practical application of pseudocode planning, modular code structure, and testing for user input validation.

Technologies Used
Python 3.x

Concepts Applied
Control Flow: Structured menu using if-elif-else

Loops: While loop for continuous user interaction

Conditionals: Used for grade categorisation

Data Structures: Lists and tuples to store student information

ChatGPT Involvement
ChatGPT was used during the planning and design stages. It helped clarify logic, propose pseudocode structures, and suggest more efficient ways to structure conditionals and loops. However, all final implementation was done independently without direct code generation by ChatGPT. Screenshots of interactions with ChatGPT are attached as a separate PDF document for reference.

How to Run
Ensure Python 3 is installed.

Open a terminal or IDE and run:

bash
Copy
Edit
python student_management_system.py
Follow the menu prompts to interact with the system.

This project demonstrates a strong understanding of programming fundamentals through a practical, hands-on system.
